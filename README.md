# My Python Learning Notes

---

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and collection of notes on **various aspects of the Python programming language**. Primarily authored and organized within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), here you'll find Markdown files detailing concepts, examples, and best practices across Python's diverse ecosystem.

I use this repository to store my continuous learning journey, quick references, and code snippets, making them easily accessible and version-controlled via GitHub.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository contains Markdown files, each focusing on different topics within Python programming. As I learn and consolidate my understanding, I'll be populating notes on a wide range of subjects, including but not limited to:

- **Python Fundamentals:** Variables, data types (strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets), operators, and control flow (if/else, loops).

- **Built-in Functions & Methods:** Deep dives into common built-in functions and methods for various data types.

- **Functions & Classes:** Defining functions, arguments, scope, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **Modules & Packages:** How to organize your code, importing modules, and creating packages.

- **Standard Library:** Notes on useful modules from Python's extensive standard library (e.g., `os`, `sys`, `math`, `datetime`, `json`).

- **Third-Party Imports:** Exploring popular libraries and frameworks (e.g., `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `flask`) as I encounter and learn them.

- **Error Handling:** `try-except` blocks and custom exceptions.

- **File I/O:** Reading from and writing to files.

- **Best Practices & Idioms:** Pythonic ways to write code, common pitfalls, and design patterns.

- **Development Workflow:** Notes on tools, environments, and version control.

## How to Navigate These Notes

Since these are Markdown files, you can easily read them directly on GitHub by clicking on the file names.

If you use **Obsidian**:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/my-python-notes.git # You might rename your local folder to 'my-python-notes' for clarity
```
2. **Open the cloned folder** as a new vault (or add it as a new folder) in Obsidian.
3. You can then navigate, search, and link between notes seamlessly within Obsidian, leveraging its graph view and internal linking capabilities.
