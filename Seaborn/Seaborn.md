# What is Seaborn?

**Seaborn** is a high-level Python data visualization library built on top of **Matplotlib**. It simplifies the process of creating attractive and informative statistical graphics by providing a more intuitive and concise API.

While Matplotlib gives you full control and flexibility over plotting, it often requires writing more code and manual styling. Seaborn, by contrast:

- Comes with **beautiful default styles** and color palettes,
- Makes it easy to create complex plots like **heatmaps, violin plots, pair plots, and regression plots** with minimal code,
- Integrates tightly with **Pandas** data structures, making plotting of DataFrames straightforward,
- Still relies on Matplotlib under the hood, so you can customize plots further by combining both libraries.
