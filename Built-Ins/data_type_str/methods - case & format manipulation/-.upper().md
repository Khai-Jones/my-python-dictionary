The `.upper()` method is a built-in string method in Python that returns a **new copy** of a string where all lowercase characters have been converted to their uppercase form. **The method returns a new string object.** It's important to note that the original string remains unchanged (strings in Python are immutable).

**How it works:**

1. It processes each character in the string.
2. If a character is a lowercase letter (a-z), it converts it to its corresponding uppercase letter (A-Z).
3. Numbers, symbols, and spaces are not affected and remain as they are in the returned string.

You use `.upper()` by attaching it to the end of a string or a string variable:

``` python
'hello'.upper()
# Output: 'HELLO'
```

``` python
print('hello'.upper())
# Output: HELLO
```

``` python
str_val = 'WoRlD'
print(str_val.upper())
# Output: WORLD
```

``` python
message = "PyThOn 123!@#"
print(message.upper())
# Output: PYTHON 123!@#
```
