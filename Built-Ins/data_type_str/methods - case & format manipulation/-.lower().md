# .upper()

The ```.lower()``` method is a built-in string method in Python that returns a new copy of a string where all uppercase characters have been converted to their lowercase form. The original string remains unchanged (strings in Python are immutable).

How it works: 

1. It processes each character in the string.
2. If a character is an uppercase letter (A-Z), it converts it to its corresponding lowercase letter (a-z).
3. Numbers, symbols, and spaces are not affected and remain as they are in the returned string. 

You use ```.lower()``` by attaching it to the end of a string or a string variable. 

``` python
'Hello'.lower()
# Output: 'hello'
```
``` python
print('Hello').lower()
# Output: hello
```
``` python
str_val = 'WoRlD'
print(str_val.lower())
# Output: world
```
``` python
message = 'PyThOn 123!@#'
print(message.lower())
# Output: python 123!@#
```
